# Day 1 of #66DAYSOFDATA
Today is my first day, and I decided to start this challenge by re-learning Python to enhance my foundation as I'd forgotten some of it's syntax.
I solved some of the questions on HackerRank and manage to reach level 3 in Python. Honestly, it only costed like 2 hours or less (I'd wasted too much time I know :'( )
So here're what I'd learnt:

# Lesson Learnt
## Usage of `*` and `**`
### Basics
Basically both of them are used to pack and unpacked iterables (Just like the name, iterables are objects that can be access one by one by using loop, eg: list, tuples, dictionary, sets)

The main differences between `*` and `**` is: `*` is used to pack multiple values into a single list while `**` can't.

To use `*` to pack values, add it infront of a variable. 
> Assignment target must be a tuple `*a, = 1,2 ` rather than `*a = 1,2`

```python
*a, = 'a', 'b', 'c'
# a
# ['a', 'b', 'c']

*a = 'a', 'b', 'c'
# SyntaxError: starred assignment target must be in a list or tuple

**a = 'a', 'b', 'c'
# Invalid syntax
```

When `*` is used infront of a variable, that variable will be assigned to anything left in the tuple of values. If there's nothing left, it will have value of empty list `[]`

```python
a, *b, c = 'this'
# a = 't'
# b = ['h','i']
# c = 's'

a, *b, c = 1, 'this'
# a = 1
# b = []
# c = 'this'
# First assign to a and then c, finally b
```

### Dictionaries
Using `*` will unpack keys only while `**` will unpack keys with values. It usually use to pass arguments to function. However, the function must have parameters with the same names as the key of the dictionary.

```python
num_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
print(**num_dict)
```

```python
def dict_sum(a,b,c):
    return a+b+c

dict_sum(**num_dict)
# 6
```

#### Merging List & Dictionaries
`*` can also be used for merging multiple lists
```python
a = [1,2,3]
b = [4,5,6]
print(*a,*b)*
# 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

`**` to merge multiple dictionaries
```python
num1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
num2 = {'c': 4, 'd': 5}
nums = {**num1, **num2}
```
> If a key appear more than once, the latter one will be used




### Advanced ( *args and **kwargs)
Both of them allow any number of keyword argument.
  
> `args` are used to pass non-keyword arguments, meaning no keyword is used in parameters. Useful for mathematics operations

#### *args Example
```python
def sum_all(*numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total

sum_all()
# 0
sum_all(1,2,3)
# 6
```

#### **kwargs Example
> `kwargs` are arguments that each is associated with a keyword. The arguments are stored as dictionary and can be accessed by using key.

```python
def shirtOrder(**kwargs):
    for key, val in kwargs.items():
        print(f'{key} costs {val}')

shirtOrder(S_size=10.0, M_size=15.0)
# S_size costs 10.0
# M_size costs 15.0
```

## List Comprehenssion
Multiple for can be used in list comprehenssion. The last `for` will be accessed first.

```python
x = 1
y = 1
z = 2
n = 3
k = [[q,w,e] for q in range(x+1) for w in range(y+1) for e in range(z+1) if q+w+e < n]
# k = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]]
# equivalent to
k=[]
for q in range(x+1):
    for w in range(y+1):
        for e in range(z+1):
            if q+w+e <n:
                k.append([q,w,e])
```
