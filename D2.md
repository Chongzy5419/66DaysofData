Continue from what I not understood yesterday. And I'd reached my target which is to achieve python lvl 4 in HackerRank. Keep it up! You can do it!
# Lesson Learnt
## Bitwise Operator
Bitwise operator can be used to do mathematical operations in bit-level. 


|Operator| Meaning|
|----|----|
|`&`| Bitwise AND|
|`\|`| Bitwise OR|
|`^`| Bitwise XOR|
|`~`| Bitwise NOT|
|`<<`| Bitwise left shift |
|`>>`| Bitwise right shift |

### Example
```python
a = 8
b = 7
print(a^b)
# 15
```
In binary, 8 equals to `1000` and 7 equals to `0100`, operating XOR on bits results in `1111` which is 15 in base-10 system

### Left & Right shift
```python
a = 8
print(a<<2)
```
From `1000` to `10000`. Shifting bits to left corresponds to multiplying the number by power of two, with the exponent equal to the number of places shifted.

> The length of bits should be maintained at 8, which is the standard byte length.

To discard extra bits, apply a bitmask with bitwise AND operator

```python
39 << 3
# 312
(39 << 3) & 255
# 56
```

Symbols for bitwise operator are used in sets too!
|Operator| Bitwise|Sets|
|----|----|----|
|`&`| Bitwise AND|intersection()|
|`\|`| Bitwise OR|union()|
|`^`| Bitwise XOR|symmetric_difference()|
|`~`| Bitwise NOT||
|`-`| x|difference()|
|`<<`| Bitwise left shift |x|
|`>>`| Bitwise right shift |x|

## Sorting Algorithm
### Sorted
Python `sorted` method is using TimSort which was first implemented by Tim Peters. It is a hybrid stable sorting algorithm which derived from merge sort and insertion sort. It has average performance of `O(n log n)`. Although it has the same complexity as quicksort, it is still faster than quicksort as python optimises it to run faster so it has smaller constant. To sort with specific rules, use argument `key`

```python
k = [['a',1],['b',5],['c',2]]
k = sorted(k, key=lambda x: (x[1],x[0]))
# sort k by evaluating numbers first then alphabets
print(k)
# [['a',1],['c', 2], ['b', 5]]
```

<br>

### Selection sort
Time complexity: `O(n2)` <br>
Suitable for small data size.
```
for i in range(5):
    largest = i
    for j in range(i+1,5):
        if k[j] > k[largest]:
            largest = j
    k[i],k[largest] = k[largest], k[i]
```

## Format string & float
Using `'{:.2f}'.format(var)` the `.2f` part is just same as `c`

```python
a = 'hii'
b = 4.5
print("{:6s} it's {:.2f}".format(a,b))
# hii    it's 4.50
```
